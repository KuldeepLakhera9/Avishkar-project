# Notification System Test Report

## Summary

This report summarizes the results of testing the notification system across all channels (email, SMS, and in-app) for the Flood Disaster Management System.

## Test Results

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Email | ❌ FAIL | Authentication error with email provider |
| SMS | ⚠️ SKIPPED | Twilio credentials not configured |
| In-App | ✅ PASS | Successfully created and verified in-app notifications |
| Alert (Combined) | ✅ PASS | Successfully created alert notifications (in-app channel only) |

## Issues Identified

### Email Notifications

**Error:** Invalid login credentials

```
Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted.
For more information, go to https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials
```

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Verify that `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` environment variables are correctly set
2. If using Gmail, ensure that "Less secure app access" is enabled or use an App Password
3. Check if 2FA is enabled on the email account, which would require an App Password

### SMS Notifications

**Status:** Skipped

**Reason:** Twilio credentials not configured

**Required Configuration:**
- `TWILIO_SID`
- `TWILIO_TOKEN`
- `TWILIO_PHONE`

## Successful Components

### In-App Notifications

The in-app notification system is working correctly. The test successfully:
- Created a test notification in the database
- Verified the notification properties
- Cleaned up the test notification

### Alert Notifications

The alert notification system partially works:
- Successfully created in-app notifications for alerts
- Email and SMS components of alerts failed due to the issues mentioned above

## Recommendations

1. **Email Configuration:**
   - Update the `.env` file with valid email credentials
   - Consider using a dedicated email service account for the application
   - If using Gmail, set up an App Password

2. **SMS Configuration:**
   - Set up a Twilio account if SMS notifications are required
   - Add the Twilio credentials to the `.env` file

3. **Testing Environment:**
   - Create a separate test environment with mock email and SMS services
   - Add test-specific environment variables to `.env.test`

## Next Steps

1. Fix email authentication issues
2. Configure SMS credentials if required
3. Implement end-to-end tests for the notification system
4. Add monitoring for notification delivery success/failure
