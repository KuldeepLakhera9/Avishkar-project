# Advanced Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The Advanced Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive tool for flood disaster management, providing predictive modeling, resource optimization, and real-time sensor monitoring capabilities. This dashboard helps emergency management teams make data-driven decisions during flood events and improve preparedness before disasters occur.

## Features

### 1. Flood Risk Prediction

- Predictive modeling of flood risks based on historical data and current conditions
- Time series forecasting with visualizations
- Risk level assessment and early warning indicators
- Interactive maps showing risk heatmaps and affected areas

### 2. Resource Optimization

- Intelligent resource allocation recommendations based on risk assessment
- Gap analysis between current and optimal resource distribution
- Evacuation route planning and capacity analysis
- Critical area prioritization and affected population metrics

### 3. Sensor Monitoring

- Real-time tracking of water level and rainfall sensors
- Status monitoring of the sensor network
- Threshold-based alerts and warning systems
- Time series visualization of sensor readings

### 4. Historical Analysis (Coming Soon)

- Long-term flood pattern analysis
- Seasonal trend identification
- Impact assessment metrics
- Comparison with historical flood events

### 5. Evacuation Planning (Coming Soon)

- Optimized evacuation routes based on traffic patterns
- Shelter capacity management
- Population distribution modeling
- Resource allocation for evacuation operations

## Technical Implementation

The Advanced Analytics Dashboard is built using:

- React for the frontend interface
- Material-UI (MUI) components for the UI design
- Recharts for data visualization
- Custom data models for predictive analytics:
  - FloodPredictionModel for risk assessment
  - SensorDataProcessor for real-time data handling
  - ResourceAllocationModel for optimization calculations

## Data Sources

The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources:

1. Historical flood records
2. Real-time sensor networks
3. Weather forecast APIs
4. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
5. Population density data
6. Resource inventory systems

## Usage Guidelines

### For Administrators

1. Use the dashboard to monitor overall flood risk across all regions
2. Identify high-risk areas requiring immediate attention
3. Approve resource allocation recommendations
4. Review and update evacuation plans

### For Municipality Officials

1. Monitor local conditions in specific regions
2. Track resource availability and deployment
3. Manage evacuation operations during flood events
4. Coordinate response teams based on optimization recommendations

### For Rescuers

1. View prioritized areas for rescue operations
2. Access real-time sensor data for situational awareness
3. Monitor evacuation routes and shelter capacities
4. Track resource allocation relevant to rescue operations

## Future Enhancements

1. Machine learning improvements for prediction accuracy
2. Integration with more IoT sensors for better coverage
3. Mobile application for field teams
4. Public-facing portal with simplified risk information
5. Automated alert systems based on prediction thresholds
