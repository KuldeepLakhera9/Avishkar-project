# UI Redesign Notes

This document summarizes the landing + auth redesign implementation so future contributors can extend or adjust branding quickly.

## Components Added

- `AppLogo` (src/components/Branding/AppLogo.jsx)
- `PublicNavBar` (src/components/Layout/PublicNavBar.jsx)
- `PublicFooter` (src/components/Layout/PublicFooter.jsx)
- `Hero` (src/components/Marketing/Hero.jsx)
- `FeatureCards` (src/components/Marketing/FeatureCards.jsx)
- `CallToAction` (src/components/Marketing/CallToAction.jsx)

## Home Page

`pages/Home.jsx` now composes the above components instead of embedding large monolithic sections. This increases maintainability and allows independent iteration.

## Logo Replacement

1. Drop your final logo asset into `src/assets` (e.g. `logo.svg`).
2. In `AppLogo.jsx` replace the inline SVG block with:  
   `import LogoSvg from '../../assets/logo.svg';`  
   `// ... inside component`  
   `<img src={LogoSvg} alt="Aqua Assists" className="h-full w-full object-contain" />`
3. Preserve accessible labeling: either keep surrounding container with `aria-label` or provide a descriptive `alt` attribute.
4. If providing dark/light variants, add a prop (e.g. `variant`) and swap assets conditionally.

## Styling Strategy

- Tailwind utilities power all layout + design; legacy `App.css` demo styles were purged.
- Gradients use brand spectrum: sky → blue → indigo; adjust via Tailwind config if brand shifts.
- Panels use translucent white with blur for depth against vibrant gradients.

## Dark Mode Implementation

### Problem Resolved

The dark mode toggle button was not working when pressed. Root cause was that the custom `ThemeProvider` was not properly integrated into the application component tree.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Added CustomThemeProvider to App Structure**: Modified `App.jsx` to wrap the entire application with `CustomThemeProvider`
2. **Enhanced Theme Context**: Improved `ThemeContext.jsx` with robust error handling, system preference detection, and reliable DOM manipulation
3. **Fixed DOM Class Management**: Replaced unreliable `classList.toggle()` with explicit add/remove operations

### Technical Details

- **Configuration**: Tailwind `darkMode: 'class'` in `tailwind.config.js`
- **State Management**: `ThemeProvider` (src/context/ThemeContext.jsx) manages theme state and localStorage persistence
- **DOM Integration**: Applies/removes `dark` class on `<html>` element for Tailwind CSS integration
- **UI Component**: Toggle in `PublicNavBar` with Sun/Moon icons, fully keyboard accessible
- **Styling**: All public marketing + auth components include `dark:` variants for backgrounds, text, borders

### Key Files Modified

- `client/src/App.jsx`: Added CustomThemeProvider wrapper to component tree
- `client/src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`: Enhanced initialization, error handling, and DOM manipulation
- `client/src/components/Common/ThemeToggle.jsx`: Cleaned up implementation for reliable state updates

### Features

- ✅ Working theme toggle functionality
- ✅ Persistent theme preferences via localStorage
- ✅ System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- ✅ Error handling for localStorage failures
- ✅ Smooth integration with existing Tailwind CSS classes

## Testing

- Added Vitest + Testing Library setup (`vitest.config.js`, `src/setupTests.js`).
- Example tests: `AppLogo`, `PublicNavBar` (mobile menu), theme toggle functionality.
- Run tests: `npm run test` (CI) or `npm run test:watch` (dev loop).
- Coverage configured (V8) — output in `coverage/` when running with `--coverage`.

## Auth Page

- `Login.jsx` reworked with glassy card, brand gradient backdrop, consistent component spacing.
- `AppLogo` added for brand consistency.

## Extensibility Ideas

- Add a `Testimonials` or `ImpactMetrics` component below `FeatureCards` if marketing expansion needed.
- Introduce a `ThemeProvider` wrapper if moving toward theming (dark mode toggle etc.).
- Convert marketing components to accept props for dynamic CMS-driven content in future.

## Clean Up / Follow Ups

- Remove any now-unused image assets from old landing (none referenced after refactor).
- Confirm routing still protects authenticated areas (unchanged by this pass).
- Consider adding basic unit snapshot tests for each new component.

## Accessibility

- Color contrast meets WCAG for primary text over gradients; verify after any brand palette adjustments.
- Interactive elements maintain clear focus states via default Tailwind ring utilities (can be enhanced later).

Last updated: dark mode + testing pass.

## Semantic Theme Tokens (New)

- Introduced CSS variable based semantic tokens in `index.css` (`--app-base`, `--app-surface`, `--app-border`, `--app-text`, `--app-muted`, `--app-accent`, `--app-accent-foreground`).
- Tailwind config maps these via `theme.extend.colors.app.*` using the `rgb(var(--token) / <alpha-value>)` pattern.
- Benefits: centralized palette swapping, consistent light/dark transitions, fewer class churns when rebranding.
- Dark mode overrides provided inside `.dark` selector.

## Lazy Loading (Marketing Sections)

- `Home.jsx` now lazy-loads `Hero`, `FeatureCards`, and `CallToAction` with `React.lazy` + `Suspense` fallback.
- Reduces initial JS bundle for faster Time To Interactive on marketing entry.
- Fallback: simple animated skeleton text; replace with richer skeleton if desired.

## Accessibility & Snapshot Testing

- Added `jest-axe` integration (`accessibility.test.jsx`) validating no critical a11y violations for `PublicNavBar` and `Home`.
- Snapshot test for `PublicNavBar` ensures structural regressions are visible in PRs.
- Matcher (`toHaveNoViolations`) registered in `setupTests.js`.

## Register Form Validation Tests

- `RegisterForm.validation.test.jsx` covers required fields, invalid email, and password complexity pattern.
- Geolocation + toast side-effects mocked to keep tests deterministic.

## Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on push/PR to `main` across Node 18 & 20.
- Steps: checkout → install → lint (server + client) → client tests with coverage + artifacts upload.
- Artifacts: `coverage/` per Node version and JUnit XML (if generated) for potential future reporting.

## Future Enhancements (Suggested)

- Add server-side test suite & integrate into CI (currently only client tests run).
- Introduce visual regression testing (e.g., Playwright + percy) for critical marketing/auth pages.
- Add axe scans for authenticated dashboard layouts once refactored to tokens fully.
- Extend semantic tokens for spacing, radii, and shadows if design system formalizes.
