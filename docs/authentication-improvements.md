# Authentication Flow Improvements

## Overview

We've enhanced the authentication flow by implementing:

1. **Token Refresh Mechanism**: Automatic renewal of JWT tokens before expiration
2. **Session Persistence**: Support for both session and persistent logins
3. **Improved State Management**: Cleaner context with separate hook implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Better error handling for authentication issues

## Key Changes

### 1. Extracted useAuth Hook

Created a separate custom hook (`useAuth.js`) to:

- Fix circular dependency issues
- Improve code organization
- Enable better testing
- Fix React Fast Refresh issues

### 2. Enhanced Token Management

- Automatic token refresh before expiration (90% of lifetime)
- Support for both session storage (temporary login) and local storage (persistent login)
- Proper cleanup of auth state on unmount
- Secure token handling

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- Better error handling in login/refresh processes
- Integration with the global error handling system
- Detailed error messages for authentication failures

### 4. Added Testing Support

Created test files for:

- Login flow
- Token refresh mechanism
- Remember me functionality

## Files Changed

1. **client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx**

   - Separated hook from context
   - Added token refresh mechanism
   - Enhanced storage handling

2. **client/src/hooks/useAuth.js**

   - New file for the extracted hook

3. **Multiple Components**
   - Updated imports to use the new hook

## Usage

```jsx
import useAuth from "../hooks/useAuth";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user, login, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

  // Use authentication state and methods
};
```

## Future Improvements

1. Implement biometric authentication option
2. Add multi-factor authentication
3. Enhance session security with IP binding
4. Implement device management for users
